  default: 'On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
    men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
    so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
    to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness
    of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These
    cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power
    of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what
    we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
    certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business
    it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
    The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection:
    he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains
    to avoid worse pains.'
