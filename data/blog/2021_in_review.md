## :iphone: Things

Last year was my final year of further education as I finally graduated from University. With that going into 2021 I was finally able to work full-time & earn a living with a paycheck.

As such there have been a number of larger purchases made this year that I was finally able to make after years of planning. There are 3 key purchases that I want to focus on:

### :computer: Macbook

After years of waiting I finally purchased [a new Macbook](https://twitter.com/nurodev/status/1463474778304622597?s=20).

Prior to this I have been using a 2016 15" Macbook Pro which has served me very well over the years but has finally begun to show its age. Everything from general performance degradation, to battery life being less than a few hours (Even after a recent battery replacement). However the most fundamental issue with the device, as those who may already be able to guess, is the keyboard.

With a fair bit of saving, I was able to finally pull the trigger in October 2021 to purchase a new [14" Macbook Pro in silver with a top specification M1 Pro processor & 16GB of RAM](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-silver-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-512gb#). After receiving the device a month or so later I am beyond happy with the device & believe it's one of the best purchases I have made for my productivity in a very long time.

I have no benchmarks to validate it but this device with its 16 CPU cores & 16 GPU cores I feel can in many scenarios stand toe to toe with my desktop Windows PC that's running a [AMD 5900X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-5900x) & a [RTX 3060 Ti](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/), all while staying cool & silent the entire time. It's mind boggling the engineering behind the device.

### :satellite: Starlink

The second big purchase of the year that came in at the very end was finally being [given access to the Starlink beta](https://twitter.com/nurodev/status/1468695438098374656?s=20).

For those unaware I live on a farm in a very isolated location and as such to get anything faster than ADSL I would need to pay BT around £20,000 to install a fiber cable to our location just to upgrade less than a handful of households. Since that wasn't, and probably never will be an option, the other options were wireless or satellite broadband. There are no WISP's in my area so that sadly rules them out & standard satellite broadband is usually pretty slow & has increased latency. As such, Starlink seemed like my best option.

A few hundred pounds & a few days of shipping from Calefornia later I finally received my Starlink kit & got it all set up & running.

This was initially just to get the kit up & running & see how the service was, even while partially obstructed. [The end results were pretty good](https://twitter.com/nurodev/status/1472865360122634244) with speeds almost reaching 300 Mbps download & 30 Mbps upload. A huge upgrade over my old ADSL connection offering less than 15 Mbps download and less than 1 Mbps upload.

### :zap: Tesla

The final & largest purchase of this year is that I finally purchased my dream car, like most tech enthusiast's, a [Tesla Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/model3).

5 years after first learning about the iPad with wheels I wanted one & have been saving up for it ever since. 5 years later, 1 deposit & 1 car trade-in later, I finally purchased my dream car.

I originally ordered a brand new model, but due to a huge demand for cars & the on-going parts shortage, I later cancelled that order and instead ordered an ex-demo model which I later learned was an ex-press car used for many UK review sites, such as [What Car?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHw3bfydrLM).
